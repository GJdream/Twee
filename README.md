*Twee was designed and built as an open source project for a presentation given at Renaissance.io 2014. This is a "must attend" conference for all iOS developers, so be sure to come next year if you missed it this year. In collaboration with the producer of Renaissance.io, Tim Burks, Twee was built into the #renio conference app to be used by the attendees. Now more about Twee...*

Discover the people around you with **Twee!**

Twee uses Bluetooth LE and your Twitter username to announce your presence to other nearby people. It also scans for other Twee users and maintains a history of people it discovers, sorted by how often they were in your vicinity.

Every time you use Twee, Twee automatically records new people it discovers. It keeps a running score based on the number of times a person is nearby and how close they are to you. Twee also provides a real time display of nearby Twee users sorted by their proximity to you.
